Subtraction template : In the book `Inside the Box`, the authors describe this template as one of the most challenging to think about because of something they call Functional Rigidity. Functional Rigidity is the inability to look at something outside the context of its normal use. The authors cite multiple examples from medical equipment to DVD players to laundry products to restructuring banks by choosing one of the existing components and eliminating it completely. 

Admittedly it sounds completely insane to cripple your product idea by removing an essential component. I mean everyone will agree that a product can be essentially made much easier and less complex by removing some of the non essential components and trimming the waste. However none of these trims leads to a fundamentally different innovative product. 

The basic list of To dos when trying to subtract is create a list of components and remove it and reimagine the product. This is extremely unintuitive to most people and it requires you to look at the problems that were succesfully solved using this method to really appreciate the method. 

As I type this on a United flight from Orlando to San Fransisco, I witnessed this method in action which is partly what inspired this post. Among one of the duties of flight attendants these days is to stand in the aisle and demonstrate the safety measures present on the flight. This requires them to completely drop everything and hurridly rush mimicking through the demonstrations directed by an equally hurried voice over the intercom. Hapless passengers lookup from their, now paused, inflight entertainment only to text their last messages till they face radio silence.  United has probably used subtraction to get rid of their security demonstrations all together. 

Surely not ! The FAA will have them for breakfast. I mean it is a part of the regulations ! 

If only there were some way to demonstrate the safety protocol! If any of you have flown United in the past 2-3 years, you would have seen a small video that uses some clever puns and visual gags instead of doing it in person. By subtracting the drill, they not only free up time from the cabin crew but the mildly entertaining video is much likely to get the eyeballs actually serving the purpose much better.
