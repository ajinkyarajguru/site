Oblique strategies were a set of cards designed by musician and composer{} that contain often vague but insightful sounding phrases. In the editing booth, {} would select a card at random and give directions to the performers on the other side of the glass. 

The nature of the phrases on the cards make them perfect way to rethink a creative process from a different point of view. Opening the app on my phone (Yes! there is an app for that too), the suggestion I got was and the next one was to "Steal a solution" and "Give the game away" which immediately made me think of the Planet Money podcast that I would highly recommend that introduced me to the subject. 

The solution that I am stealing from the podcast that has done the heavy lifting and research. Even though NPR did the work of interviewing {}, a significant portion of you will remember me as having introduced you to Oblique Strategies. And the other direction basically explains itself. I had tapped to get another suggestion even before deciding to write about stealing a solution. I had several in between that I ignored infact. At the end of the day, the strategies are "suggestions" at best. Do not let them dictate the content but rather use them as inspiration to think differently about the mundane.
