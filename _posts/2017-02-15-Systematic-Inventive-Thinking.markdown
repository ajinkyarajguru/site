Inside the Box : The authors of the fantastic book, Inside the Box, Drew Boyd and Jacob Goldberg challenge the core tenet of thinking outside the box. Thinking of a fanciful moonshot idea to solve a problem as the source of innovation. Thinking outside the box imagines removing all constraints from the problem and thinking of a Kobayashi Maru solution to the problem. For those who did not get that reference, Kobayashi Maru is a reference to the notorious computer simulated test in the Star Trek universe that challenges future Starfleet officers mettle. The test involves a set of decisions that the officer has to make, each with horrible consequences. 

Spoiler Alert : Starfleet produces only two officers that succesfully beat the test that we know of. However I would contend that their 'solution' is not a solution at all. Their response to the Kobayashi Maru is to reprogram the  computer to make one of the choices acceptable. However that completely misses the point of the simulation in the first place. Redefining chess pieces to move differently is hardly considered innovative gameplay afterall. The constraints of the computer simulation or the restricted motion of the chess pieces is supposed to make the challenge more engaging. 

The so called succesful solution to the Kobayashi Maru would be succesful only if the participants were in a simulation all along a `la Neo from the Matrix where understanding the nature of the limitations can allow them to overcome it by just wishing them away. Pending any compelling fan theories, we can assume that Spock and Picard inhabit the same material universe as us and Decartes demon where limitations are real. Sometimes overcoming these limitations is significantly harder than just wishing them away.

The authors of the book have listed certain `templates` for innovative thinking. These templates are short cuts to think the right way about the problem so that the solution does not end up being a flight of fancy that costs too much or is always 10 years away.

The thing that underlies these templates is that you start from a problem and something that already exists. None of the pathbreaking innovative products were in reality the first-of-their-kind in the market. Innovation of a kind that no one has seen before probably also is of the kind that no one needs. Too often we are afraid of being derivative of our own work that pushes us in the wrong direction. I completely expect that I will be writing a better version of this post in the future but trying to perfect this draft simply makes it impossible for me to publish anything at all.
